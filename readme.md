This is a simple weather searching app, made with pure Javascript, HTML, CSS, Skycons animated icons https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/ and OpenWeatherMap Api.

You can run it simpy by opening html file with your web browser, write valid city name in search field and click search button and you will see current weather brodcast for that location.

This is a simple project created by me, Espreesso. Feel free to use my code if you wish.
